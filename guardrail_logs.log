Generators are functions that allow you to iterate over a sequence of values without having to store them all in memory at once. They are useful when you have a large dataset that you don't want to load into memory all at once, or when you want to generate values on the fly.

For example, let's say you have a large file with a million lines of data, and you want to process each line one at a time. You could use a generator function to read the file line by line, like this:

```python
def read_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line

for line in read_file('data.txt'):
    # process the line
```

In this example, the `read_file` function is a generator function that reads the file line by line and yields each line one
